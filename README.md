# Pydantic Playground

In this project we test the Python library Pydantic in order to practice with modeling data validation.

## Installation

1. Install Python (e.g. via Anaconda https://www.anaconda.com/download/)

2. Install Pydantic (https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/install/)

3. If you miss a dataset on which you intend to test the Pydantic library, we suggest you to git clone this github repository https://github.com/shivamshinde123/Thyroid_Disease_Detection_Internship


## Usage

Run pydantic_playground\scripts\test_pydantic.ipynb by providing the dataset found in https://github.com/shivamshinde123/Thyroid_Disease_Detection_Internship/blob/main/Data/Raw_data/ThyroidRawData.csv
You can also run it on your own dataset, but you will have to edit the code in order to fit your own set of features.
